Yammer Clear Inbox

Experiencing Inbox overload on Yammer? Use this handy bookmarklet to have each message cleared for you. A bookmarklet is a browser bookmark that will execute some code for you.

Simply create a new bookmark/bookmarklet in your browser and add the code from the JS folder!

* To create a bookmarklet right click on your bookmark bar and add a 'New Page' (left: in Chrome) or 'New Bookmark' (right: in FireFox).

* Add the code to the URL (left: in Chrome) or Location(right: in FireFox) input and save the bookmark.

* Now go to your Yammer Inbox and click the Yammer-ClearInbox button on your bookmark bar and watch your unread inbox count drop to zero. 

If you're not sure how to do the above steps you can:

* View the [bookmarklet](https://cdn.rawgit.com/PaulSpoerry/YammerClearInbox/master/YammerClearInbox.html) here and drag it onto your bookmark bar.

* Save the YammerClearInbox.html to your local machine, open it in your browser, and then drag the bookmarklet onto your bookmark bar. 

Alternatively, grab the JS and execute it in your console.
